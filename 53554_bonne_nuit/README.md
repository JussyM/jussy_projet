[ Game name ]

The game is call good night "bonne nuit" in french basically made for children.

[ Rules ]

In the explanation of the rule, the red pawns are called "boxes".
First phase :
Each player, when it is their turn, rolls the dice. He advances the dewdrop as many squares as
points obtained, in a clockwise direction, and place the drop on the affected square.
He then places a star of his color around this square, a few centimeters away.
So the first star lights up in the sky.
Each player thus plays in the same way. The sky is filling with stars.
Second phase :
Turn off the light. If it is really dark, we can no longer see the color of the pawns but only the
phosphorescent stars. The adult invites the continuation of the game: which star will shine the most
long at night?
Each child hopes it is theirs.
To play is no longer to throw the dice but to extinguish a star, turning it over and hoping that it is
not one of his (memory or chance!).
So the stars go out one by one (both those of the players and those that do not belong to
nobody) ... and when there's only one left on the table, turn on the light to find out
whoever wins the game.
